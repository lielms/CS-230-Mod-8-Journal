The client, The Gaming Room requested help with creation of a software design document, development of their application, and addressing software requirements.  The Gaming Room was seeking to 
create a web-based game for multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.
In developing the documentation specific requirement and recommendations were outlined in the document
Proper documentation allowed much ease when developing the program. All requirements having been clearly listed could easily be checked to ensure all requirements were met and working properly.
If I were to revise this document I would complete the System Architecture View portion so that The Gaming Room would have a clearer understanding of the topology of the application such as
structure, behavior, and interactions
In designing the document the needs and requirements of the client were taken as a priority and stayed within the clients limitations
When approaching the design of the software a singleton pattern was used to ensure several things. The singleton patten ensured only a single instance of the GameService class could
exist in memory at a time. This also made sure a team or player were also unique.
An iterator pattern was also used to access objects sequentially.
